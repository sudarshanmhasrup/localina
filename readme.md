### About this project

Localization is one of the most important aspects of the user experience when building software that supports
inclusivity by allowing users to use your software in their preferred language. Compose Multiplatform supports
localization out of the box, but changing the locale in real time is a bit trickier and requires writing a lot of
boilerplate code, which is also challenging to understand. `Localina` Is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that allows you
to update the locale of your Compose Multiplatform app in real time.
